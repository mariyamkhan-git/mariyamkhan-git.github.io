    <h1>A Few Poems by Ogden Nash</h1>
    <h2>The Panther</h2>
    <p>The panther is like a leopard,<br>Except it hasn't been peppered.<br>Should you behold panther crouch,<br>Prepare to say Ouch.<br>Better yet, if called by a panther,<br>Don't anther.
    </p>
    <h2>Lines on Facing Forty</h2>
    <p>I have a bone to pick with fate,<br>Come here and tell me girly,<br>Do you think my mind is maturing late,<br>Or simply rotting early.</p>
    <h2>The Lama</h2>
    <p>The one-l lama,<br>He's a priest.<br>The two-l llama,<br>He's a beast.<br>And I will bet<br>A silk pajama<br>There isn't any<br>Three-l lllama.</p>
